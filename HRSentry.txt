Think about the most cherished live event you experienced. Now think about that experience and the billions around the globe who yearn to gather and rekindle human connection. Eventbrite is going to lead the return of live experiences. We are going to bring the world together again but this lofty ambition relies on the foundation of top talent and strong company culture. That is where you come in!
THE TEAM
We want to harness our mission, the brilliance of our business, and the culture of our company - to find, attract, and onboard the best humans for that mission. Hiring the best talent globally is no easy feat. Our up-and-coming Talent Acquisition (TA) team, when firing on all cylinders, can passionately connect that vision and story with top-notch talent in a highly candidate-centric manner, building relationships long before the hire and on through the person’s Eventbrite experience. When we’re winning here, we’re rallying behind a talent strategy that inspires, with a blend of science and passion.
THE ROLE & IMPACT
The nature of Eventbrite’s ambitious mission calls for a world class organization of high performing, passionate individuals who build on our culture and carry us past the re-opening of live events and onto the next stage of growth. If successful, this individual will be widely respected as the person leading the passion, strategy and delivery of how we accomplish that! This will include leading on: analytics that help us find the diverse talent needed to win, employment branding and how we’re positioning ourselves globally in a post-pandemic world, talent intelligence (and the mapping of our strategy to business needs for each market), and an extraordinary candidate experience. In building a world class company via a world class TA function, the person in this role will position the hiring managers to own the success of their hiring efforts and be one step ahead of everyone on the talent plan. A winning impact will be partly in the metrics - but also in the narrative of the TA team members being widely viewed as essential partners and one step ahead of the business in meeting the organizational talent needs.
The VP, Talent Acquisition will be based in the USA and report into the Chief Human Resources Officer.
THE SKILL SET & EXPERIENCE
The ideal candidate will bring the right balance of collaboration, influence, and expert leadership - making people feel heard, but also biasing toward decisive action and impact, by urgently positioning their team for success. More specifically:

Demonstrable success in building forward-thinking talent strategy with executive and TA teams in a collaborative fashion and shaping / executing arms of the strategy accordingly (eg. employment branding, early career talent practices, analytics that move the org faster and net higher quality talent, etc.)
Adept at presenting and communicating complex plans in a simple and compelling manner - to executive teams and the board of directors
Track record of leading employment branding strategies via strong partnership (eg. with Comms) and innovative solutions to stand out amongst competition and / or lower awareness markets.
A proven track record of success in building and leading highly effective TA strategy in global / distributed organizations (bonus if in tech / growth environments). Leadership experience in mentoring, managing and developing high performing teams
Expertise in driving TA excellence, leveraging data to improve everything from candidate experience, flexible requisition balancing that anticipates future needs, quality of hire, funnel optimization, etc.
Expertise in leading a suite of TA tools and 3rd party services that work in concert with, and provide the right lift to, the TA team
Expertise in adopting evidenced-based solutions that result in greater diversity and inclusion in hiring efforts (and, contrarily, resolving practices that inhibit D&I in those efforts). Adept at directly challenging leaders on their role here and how to improve
Adept at using metrics and analytics to lead an anticipatory hiring model (eg. forecasting net and backfill hiring needs to ensure the org is resourced for the hiring needs) and keep executives informed on progress and decisions through simple and effective communications / presentations
A role model of collaboration with key partners (eg. Finance, Communications, executive teams) and conviction / courage when push-back is needed to challenge assumptions
A deep understanding of the highly competitive and evolving (eg. remote work) talent markets
Willingness to roll up sleeves, embracing a dynamic & high-growth environment
An unyielding passion to provide the ultimate candidate experience
And last but not least - Eventbrite affinity! Be inspired by our mission and passionate about amplifying our culture

52	30+ days ago	Vital Farms	Grower Recruiter	"You’re the kind of person that people love to know. You’re easy to talk to, you’re a great listener, and you know just about everyone in town. From chili cookoffs to local fundraisers, you know who’s who, what’s what, and what’s next. In fact, you know so many people in your community that when you go to the local diner, it takes you at least 20 minutes just to get to your table because of all the hand-shaking, back-slapping, and catching up with folks at the counter. Simply put, you’re a connector. You’re curious, you’re kind, and you have a genuine interest in helping the people around you.

That’s why we want to talk to you about joining us as our new Grower Recruiter at Vital Farms.
Because you see, we’re on a mission at Vital Farms to change the food industry one ethically-sourced ingredient at a time. While we’re known for our pasture raised eggs - giving our hens 108 square feet to roam and calling bullsh*t on terms like cage free and free range - the truth is we’ve got big plans to do so much more. That’s because we give a cluck when it comes to the health of our animals, the health of our customers, and the health of our planet.

If that all sounds like something you care about, too, let’s talk about how you can continue to make connections and make a difference as our new Grower Recruiter at Vital Farms.

Reporting to the Director of Live Production, the Grower Recruiter will proactively find and recruit passionate new farmers to help grow our network of small family farms. In other words, you’ll connect the dots and spark conversations between people at financial institutions, chicken feed mills, and animal welfare enthusiasts in an effort to bring new opportunities to enthusiastic farmers who are looking for a change. And when you do connect with someone who’s passionate about animal welfare, with the perfect property and a desire to raise the standards for laying hens, as the Grower Recruiter, you’ll help them understand our stakeholder model and explain what it takes to be a successful grower at Vital Farms. You’ll answer their questions, assess their property, and help them get their paperwork in order when it comes to financing.

Passionate, personable, and with an entrepreneurial mindset for getting things done, you’ll work closely with potential growers from initial introductions all the way to contract signing. In addition to maintaining detailed notes and tracking activity through online and paper applications, here are some other projects and priorities you can expect on a daily basis:
Build a massive word of mouth referral network that includes growers, banks, barn builders, and more.
Work with the Grower Support Administration Manager to schedule community meetings with prospective growers.
Follow a clearly defined process, ensuring a positive experience for all stakeholders.
What you bring to the table:
First, you bring a big ol’ helping of passion for ethically-sourced, nutritious food and purpose-driven brands. And you bring extra napkins.
You have at least 2 years of recruiting or sales experience; you know how to build rapport and close the deal at the same time.
You’re proactive and solutions-focused; you don’t wait to be asked to solve a problem.
You are focused on customer service and provide a top-notch experience to potential growers; you never leave people hanging and you always get back to them with answers to their questions.
You can work comfortably under minimal direct supervision; note that your manager will be based remotely.
You are flexible, adaptable, and bring an appropriate sense of urgency to your work.
You have strong networking abilities and have strong community ties.
You are available to travel 75% of the time for community meetings and one on one meetings with farmers.
You believe “we” is greater than “me”. You know the power of teamwork and celebrate the work of others before your own.
You give a sh*t. About the animals. About relationships. About keeping things real. You believe in acting like an owner and making Vital Farms a place to be proud of.
You hold yourself to the highest standards and you strive to improve yourself and others each and every day, even Saturdays when you teach conflict resolution techniques at the local community center, highlighting the power of empathy and intonation.
You can walk in someone else’s boots – You seek to understand other’s viewpoints and think that you get to better answers by sitting on the same side of the table.
Honest conversations don’t ruffle your feathers and you don’t walk on eggshells. If you see something in the organization that can be improved, you’re not afraid to speak up and you expect your colleagues to do the same.
A fast-paced, energetic environment with passionate people who are leading a movement to bring ethically produced food to the table
Competitive pay and benefits (Medical, Dental, Vision, Paid Parental Leave, and weekly lunches, just to name a few)
Company-wide bonus program; when we succeed together, we celebrate together
Generous retirement contributions: 401(k) + 3% Contribution from Day 1
Free eggs, butter, and ghee, along with friends and family discounts
Fun team SWAG that will make you the talk of the town
Professional development opportunities and an amazing team dedicated to your growth.
Who We Are:
Vital Farms is a Certified B Corp that sources and markets delicious, high-quality, ethically-sourced egg and dairy products nationwide. We started on a single family-farm in Austin, TX in 2007, with 20 Rhode Island hens and a drive to raise the standards in sustainable agriculture. Today Vital Farms THE leading producer of pasture raised eggs, partnering with more than 200 family farms, and selling into over 13,000 grocery stores around the country. We believe that a healthy bottom line is the result of healthy business practices, and we care deeply about supporting all our stakeholders. This includes our crew, our consumers, our retailers, and of course our happy hens and contented cows. In short, we exist to improve the lives of people, animals, and our planet through food.
Next Steps:
Shortly after you complete your application, you'll receive a follow-up email elaborating on any potential next steps in our process. If you don't immediately receive said follow-up email, we would highly encourage you to check your spam filter!

In order to fulfill Vital Farms mission to “bring ethically produced food to the table,” we seek to build teams that leverage diverse perspectives to create a welcoming and innovative environment that is committed to the principles of equal employment opportunities.
To that end, we make employment decisions based on qualifications, merit, and business need.
